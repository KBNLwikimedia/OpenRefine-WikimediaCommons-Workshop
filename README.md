# Workshop OpenRefine & Wikimedia Commons

[OpenRefine](https://openrefine.org/) is a well-known tool for editing, enriching and manipulating data. It is widely used within the Wikimedia community to add data to Wikidata. As from version 3.7, you can also upload images to Wikimedia Commons, enriched with [structured data](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Structured_data).

## Learning objectives
In this workshop you will learn
 * how to use OpenRefine to upload new images with regular file descriptions (Wikitext) and structured data to Wikimedia Commons, and
 * how to add structured data to existing Commons files, using OpenRefine

## Target audience
This workshop is suitable for people who have used OpenRefine before to add data to Wikidata, and who know what "reconciling against Wikidata" means, but who do not yet know how to use OpenRefine to add images and structured data to Wikimedia Commons. This workshop is therefore **not suitable for** people who have never worked with OpenRefine and/or Wikidata.

 ## Required preparation
* Please bring your own laptop to this workshop.
* Make sure youy know your way around OpenRefine v 3.4, 3.5 or 3.6, and are comfortable with reconciling and uploading data to Wikidata.
* Install OpenRefine 3.7 SNAPSHOT on your machine. It can be downloaded at https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine#snapshot-releases. Version 3.6.2 (or older) is therefore **not** suitable, because you cannot upload files to Wikimedia Commons with it.
* If you have time: check out [OpenRefine 3.7+ â€“ How to upload new files to Wikimedia Commons](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19eiMeq3XssiPrT9b04E-8XyE-desBEzYNgygLDYKP4o/edit)
